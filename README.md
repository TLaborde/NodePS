NodePS
=============

This is a WebServer written in PowerShell, as a module, which is able to read and execute PowerShell code.

* Thanks to Yusuf Ozturk of [PoSH Server](http://www.poshserver.net/) fame for the original codebase
* Thanks to [RamblingCookieMonster](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster) for his blog articles about PowerShell modules and about contributing
* Thanks to my teammates and my bosses, for the feedbacks and support

Caveats:

* Requires Powershell v4 minimum
* No testing published. Maybe one day when I get around reading on Pester. Contributions welcome!
* Naming conventions and coding style subject to change. Suggestions welcome!
* In order to run the server as a non-local Administrator you must reserve the url prefix being used ahead of time for the user account that will be running the server using the following procedure:

   1. Run command prompt as a local administrator
   2. Run the following command **netsh http add urlacl url=https://127.0.0.1:443/ user=MYDOMAIN\UserName**



#Functionality

* Webserver allowing to publish script written in PowerShell. Like NodeJS for JavaScript. But multithreaded out-off-the-box.
* Basic Auth, Windows Auth (local or domain)
* Can be used to server static files (for production, it's better to reverse proxy and use IIS for static content)
* Support JSON and XML headers in response
* "Safe" threads running the PowerShell script
* Shared variables between threads available (for session or other)
* IP filtering, content blocking
